"""Outbound MCP connections: the one place a FastMCP ``Client`` is built.

Every path that talks to a remote MCP server — the agent runtime
(``app/runtime/toolset.py``), the handshake probes (``connectivity.py``) and the
MCP-app endpoints — gets its client from :func:`build_client`, so the three
things auxilia needs on top of the framework defaults are decided once:

* **MCP Apps capability.** Servers gate UI-bearing tools (Metabase's
  ``visualize_query``) behind the client advertising the
  ``io.modelcontextprotocol/ui`` extension during the handshake. The SDK's
  ``advertise()`` does exactly that; it replaced a class-level monkeypatch of
  ``ClientSession.initialize`` that rebuilt private capability assembly.
* **Lenient output validation.** ``ClientSession.call_tool`` validates a
  result's ``structuredContent`` against the tool's ``outputSchema`` and raises
  on mismatch. Some servers (Metabase) declare schemas their own output does
  not satisfy, so the result would die before the model saw it.
  :class:`LenientClientSession` logs instead, installed through FastMCP's
  ``TransportOptions.session_class`` — the hook its own proxy uses to skip the
  same validation.
* **Session termination.** The MCP-app endpoints must *not* ``DELETE`` the
  session on exit: Metabase binds the ``sessionToken`` embedded in the widget
  HTML to the MCP session, so terminating it kills the token before the
  browser uses it. The SDK transport takes ``terminate_on_close``; FastMCP's
  ``StreamableHttpTransport`` does not forward it, hence the small subclass.

The FastMCP client is reentrant and hosts its session in a background task, so
its context manager may be entered and exited from different tasks — the
reason the runtime used to host every session in a dedicated task is gone.
